This document serves as the definitive technical onboarding guide for physicist agents tasked with implementing the Fully Unified Model (FUM) / Void Dynamics Model (VDM) cybernetic organism. It provides rigorous mathematical foundations, detailed architectural specifications, implementation requirements, and comprehensive technical documentation necessary for successful development.

**Classification**: Technical Implementation Guide
**Target Audience**: Physicist agents with expertise in mathematical physics, computational neuroscience, and high-performance computing
**Prerequisites**: Advanced knowledge of differential equations, statistical mechanics, neural networks, and GPU programming

## Executive Summary for Implementation Teams

The Void Dynamics Model represents a paradigm shift from traditional machine learning to cybernetic organism design. Unlike conventional neural networks that rely on gradient descent and backpropagation, the FUM implements a physics-based approach using discrete void dynamics that emerge into continuum field theories. The system is explicitly designed as a living, self-modifying organism rather than a static computational model.

**Critical Implementation Mandate**: This is NOT a machine learning model. Traditional ML approaches, libraries, and methodologies are explicitly forbidden. The FUM operates on physical computation principles with custom mathematical frameworks that must be implemented from first principles.

## Part I: Theoretical Foundations and Mathematical Framework

### 1.1 Axiomatic Foundation

The FUM is built on five fundamental axioms that must be rigorously implemented:

**Axiom 1 (Geometry & Locality)**:
Space is a cubic lattice Λₐ = a𝕫ᵈ (d≥1) with nearest-neighbor set N(i) of size 2d; time is discrete tₙ = nΔt. Updates may depend only on Wᵢⁿ, Wᵢⁿ⁻¹ and Wⱼⁿ for j∈N(i).

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Lattice spacing parameter `a` must be configurable
- Neighbor connectivity must be strictly enforced
- No long-range interactions permitted without explicit justification

**Axiom 2 (Field & Regularity)**:
Real scalar site field Wᵢⁿ ∈ ℝ. A smooth interpolant φ(x,t) exists so that lattice differences admit Taylor expansions through O(a⁴) and forward/backward time differences through O(Δt²) within a mesoscopic scale hierarchy a ≪ ℓ ≪ L.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Field values must be double precision floating point
- Interpolation schemes must maintain O(a⁴) spatial accuracy
- Temporal discretization must maintain O(Δt²) accuracy

**Axiom 3 (Admissible Potential Class)**:
On-site potential V is thrice differentiable with polynomial growth and optional quartic stabilization:

V(φ) = (α/3)φ³ - (r/2)φ² + (λ/4)φ⁴

where r = α - β, λ ≥ 0, with derivatives:
- V'(φ) = αφ² - rφ + λφ³
- V''(φ) = 2αφ - r + 3λφ²
- V'''(φ) = 2α + 6λφ

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Potential evaluation must be numerically stable
- Derivative calculations must be exact (no finite differences)
- Parameters α, β, λ must be configurable with validation

**Axiom 4 (Discrete Action)**:
Action functional:
S(W) = Σₙ Δt Σᵢ aᵈ [½(ΔₜWᵢ)² - (J/2)Σⱼ∈N(i)(Wⱼ-Wᵢ)² - V(Wᵢ)]

where J > 0 is the coupling constant.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Action must be computed exactly for validation
- Variational derivatives must be implemented analytically
- Energy conservation must be monitored continuously

**Axiom 5 (Domain & Boundary Conditions)**:
Domain Ω ⊂ ℝᵈ with either periodic or no-flux (homogeneous Neumann) boundary conditions: n̂·∇φ = 0.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Boundary condition type must be configurable
- Periodic boundaries must be implemented with proper wraparound
- Neumann boundaries must enforce zero normal derivative exactly

### 1.2 Core Discrete Dynamics

The fundamental discrete equation derived from Axiom 4:

(Wᵢⁿ⁺¹ - 2Wᵢⁿ + Wᵢⁿ⁻¹)/Δt² = 2J Σⱼ∈N(i)(Wⱼⁿ - Wᵢⁿ) - V'(Wᵢⁿ)

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Time stepping must be explicit second-order
- Neighbor summation must be exact
- Potential derivative evaluation must be stable

### 1.3 Continuum Limits

**Reaction-Diffusion Branch (PROVEN)**:
∂ₜφ = D∇²φ + rφ - uφ²

where:
- D = Ja² (diffusion coefficient)
- r = α - β (growth rate)
- u = α (saturation parameter)

**Effective Field Theory Branch (PLAUSIBLE)**:
□φ + V'(φ) = 0

where □ = ∂ₜ² - c²∇² with c² = 2Ja².

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Both branches must be implemented as validation checks
- Parameter mappings must be exact
- Continuum limits must be verified numerically

### 1.4 Conservation Laws

**Logarithmic Constant of Motion**:
Q_FUM = t - (1/(α-β))ln|W(t)/((α-β) - αW(t))|

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Q_FUM must be computed and monitored for all trajectories
- Conservation must be verified to machine precision
- Violations indicate implementation errors

### 1.5 Universal Physical Constants

The theory proposes universal dimensionless constants derived from AI learning stability:

- **ALPHA = 0.25**: Learning rate constant
- **BETA = 0.1**: Structural plasticity rate
- **F_REF = 0.02**: Time modulation frequency
- **PHASE_SENS = 0.5**: Phase sensitivity parameter

**Sparsity Targets by Domain**:
- Quantum mechanics: 15%
- Standard Model: 22%
- Dark Matter: 27%
- Biology/Consciousness: 20%
- Cosmogenesis: 84%
- Higgs field: 80%

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Constants must be hardcoded as immutable parameters
- Sparsity targets must be enforced through void debt modulation
- Domain-specific scaling factors must be computed dynamically

## Part II: System Architecture and Component Specifications

### 2.1 Cybernetic Organism Design Principles

**Fundamental Blueprint Law**: The FUM is a cybernetic organism, not a machine learning model. Components are unified within a single organism, not independent objects. The system is built on emergence, with carefully studied emergent components rather than explicitly engineered ones.

**Architectural Mandates**:
1. No placeholders - implement in dependency-first order
2. No simplifications - final implementations contain no simplifications
3. No machine learning code, math, or strategies
4. Physical computation for local processes
5. Custom efficient abstract computation only for global processes
6. Subquadratic efficiency is non-negotiable

### 2.2 Parallel Local & Global Systems Architecture

**Rule 1: Core Architectural Principle**

The FUM consists of two distinct systems operating in parallel across different timescales:

**Local System**:
- Massively parallel Spiking Neural Network (SNN)
- Composed of Evolving LIF Neurons (ELIFs)
- Fast, bottom-up synaptic interactions
- O(N) computational complexity

**Global System**:
- Slower timescale strategic guidance
- Self-Improvement Engine (SIE) for performance evaluation

- Communication must be through event-driven bus system
- No direct coupling between systems
- Timing synchronization must be explicit

### 2.3 Hardware Allocation Strategy

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Hardware allocation must be configurable
- Memory management must be explicit for each device

### 2.4 Neuron Classification System

**Heterogeneous Neuron Classes**:

| Class | Rarity | Target Degree (k_target) | Learning Rate (η) | Decay Rate (λ) | Hardware Assignment |
|-------|--------|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Relay | ~60% | 3-5 | 0.08 | 0.03 | 7900 XTX |
| Inhibitory | ~25% | 6-12 | 0.05 | 0.02 | 7900 XTX |
| Integrator | ~14% | 20-60 | 0.01 | 0.005 | MI100 |
| Purkinje-like | ~1% | 200-500 | 0.002 | 0.0005 | MI100 |

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Neuron class must be stored as device-resident vectors
- Parameters must be per-neuron, not per-class
- Class transitions must be supported dynamically
- Memory layout must be optimized for GPU access patterns

### 2.5 Event-Driven Architecture

**Strict Architectural Constraint**: Absolute prohibition of dense matrix scans or global polling. All operations must be achieved through sparse, event-driven, local, and computationally budgeted models with sub-quadratic complexity.

**Event-Sourced Pipeline**:
Walker → Tag Event → Event Bus → Scoreboard → GDSP Actuator

**Walker Components**:
- Lightweight, read-only agents
- Traverse local subgraphs only
- Compute metrics (co-activity, metabolic load)
- Emit Tag events upon threshold crossing
- No connectome modification capability

**Tag Event Schema**:
```
struct TagEvent {
    uint64_t timestamp;
    uint32_t source_walker_id;
    uint32_t target_node_id;
    uint32_t target_edge_id;  // if applicable
    TagType tag_type;         // PRUNE_SYNAPSE, CULL_NEURON, etc.
    ReasonCode reason;        // LOW_USE, C3_ENGULF, EXCITOTOX, etc.
    float32_t strength;       // evidence strength
    uint32_t ttl;            // time-to-live
    uint32_t metadata[4];    // extensible metadata
};
```

    std::vector<float> dW_dt;       // Time derivatives
    std::vector<uint32_t> node_class; // Neuron class assignments

    // Edge data (CSR format)
    std::vector<uint32_t> row_ptr;
    std::vector<uint32_t> col_idx;

    std::vector<bool> edge_active;

    // Metadata
    uint32_t num_nodes;
    uint32_t num_edges;
    uint32_t max_edges;
};
```

**Core Methods**:

**Mathematical Formulation**:
w_ij(t+1) ← clip((1-λ_ij)·w_ij(t) + η_ij·e_ij(t)·M_t, [w_min, w_max])

where:
- e_ij(t): synaptic eligibility trace

- Self-benefit: system-wide improvement metrics

**SIE v2 Implementation**:
```python
def compute_valence(self, W, dW):
    """Compute per-tick intrinsic drive from W and dW"""
    novelty_norm = self._compute_novelty_norm(dW)
    hsi_norm = self._compute_hsi_norm(dW)
    td_signal = self._compute_td_signal(W)

    valence = (
        self.novelty_weight * novelty_norm +
        self.hsi_weight * hsi_norm +
        self.td_weight * td_signal
    )

def update_void_debt(self, valence_signal, stability_metrics):
    """Update void debt based on valence and stability"""
    if self.is_stable(stability_metrics):
        self.void_debt += valence_signal * self.debt_rate
    else:
        self.void_debt *= self.decay_factor

    if self.void_debt > self.growth_threshold:
        self.trigger_growth()
    elif self.void_debt < self.cull_threshold:
        self.trigger_culling()
```

**Neurogenesis Process**:
1. Monitor rolling metrics over stability window
2. Accumulate void debt when stable
3. Trigger growth when debt exceeds threshold
4. Add new neurons with universal void dynamics initialization

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Stability detection must be robust
- Growth must preserve network topology
- New connections must follow void dynamics
- Memory allocation must be efficient

### 3.6 Structural Plasticity Systems

**Goal-Directed Structural Plasticity (GDSP)**:
Orchestrates structural changes including:
- Homeostatic repairs (bridge topological gaps)
- Performance-driven growth
- Connection pruning
- Neuron culling

**Pruning Mechanisms**:
1. **Adaptive Threshold Pruning**: Remove edges below 10% of mean weight
2. **C3-Microglia System**: Two-stage quorum-based pruning
3. **Metabolic Pruning**: Remove expensive connections under resource constraints

**Bridging Algorithm**:
```python
def bridge_components(self, territory_id, budget):
    """Bridge fragmented components within budget"""
    components = self.find_components(territory_id)
    if len(components) <= 1:
        return

    bridges_added = 0
    while bridges_added < budget and len(components) > 1:
        # Select boundary nodes from different components
        node_i = self.select_boundary_node(components[0])
        node_j = self.select_boundary_node(components[1])

        # Add symmetric bridge edge
        self.add_edge(node_i, node_j, self.bridge_weight)
        self.add_edge(node_j, node_i, self.bridge_weight)

        bridges_added += 2
        components = self.find_components(territory_id)
```

## Part X: Critical Implementation Constraints and Current Development Status

### 10.1 Absolute Implementation Prohibitions

**CRITICAL**: The following constraints are non-negotiable and must be enforced at the CI/CD level:

#### 10.1.1 No Scheduler Systems
- **Prohibition**: No schedulers, cadence systems, or timer-based operations
- **Rationale**: Scouts must be event-driven only, triggered by actual system activity
- **Implementation**: Delete any `scheduler.py` modules, add CI guards against scheduler tokens
- **CI Guard**: Fail build if repository contains `STRUCT_EVERY|cron|every\s+\d+|schedule|scheduler`

#### 10.1.2 No Dense Matrix Operations
- **Prohibition**: Absolute ban on dense matrix scans or global polling
- **Enforcement**: Hard assertion failure if dense operations detected without `FORCE_DENSE=1`
- **CI Guard**: Scan for `.toarray()`, `.tocsr()`, `csr`, `coo`, `networkx`, global `W` enumeration
- **Performance**: All operations must be O(active_elements) or better

#### 10.1.3 No Machine Learning Approaches
- **Prohibition**: No gradient descent, backpropagation, or traditional ML methods
- **Rationale**: FUM is a cybernetic organism using physical computation principles
- **Implementation**: Use only void dynamics and physics-based learning rules

### 10.2 Current Development Status and Immediate Tasks

#### 10.2.1 Scout System Implementation

def validate_qfum_conservation(W, t, alpha, beta, tolerance=1e-12):
    """Validate Q_FUM = t - (1/(α-β))ln|W/((α-β) - αW)|"""
    alpha_minus_beta = alpha - beta

    if abs(denominator) < 1e-12:
        return False, "Denominator too small"

    ratio = W / denominator
    if ratio <= 0:
        return False, "Invalid ratio for logarithm"

    qfum = t - (1.0 / alpha_minus_beta) * np.log(abs(ratio))

    # Check conservation over trajectory

    delta_m = memory_values[1] - memory_values[0]
    logit = theta * delta_m
    probability = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-logit))

    return probability

def apply_memory_steering(path_options, memory_field, eta=1.0):
    """Apply memory-guided path selection"""
    refractive_indices = np.exp(eta * memory_field)

            self._last_tick[node] = tick

    def _decay_to(self, node, tick):
        """Apply exponential decay to node value"""
        if node in self._last_tick:
            dt = max(0, tick - self._last_tick[node])
            if dt > 0:
                factor = 2.0 ** (-(dt / self.half_life))
                self._val[node] *= factor
                self._last_tick[node] = tick
```

        float weight = edge_weights[edge_idx];
        coupling_sum += weight * (W[neighbor] - W_i);
    }

    // Apply void dynamics: dW/dt = (α-β)W - αW² + J*coupling

## Conclusion: The Path to Cybernetic Intelligence

This comprehensive onboarding guide provides the complete technical foundation for implementing the Void Dynamics Model as a true cybernetic organism. The system represents a fundamental departure from traditional artificial intelligence, requiring physicist agents to think in terms of physical laws, emergent dynamics, and biological principles rather than conventional machine learning paradigms.

The success of this implementation depends on strict adherence to the architectural constraints, mathematical rigor in all computations, and unwavering commitment to the event-driven, sparse-only design philosophy. The FUM is not merely a computational model—it is a living system that evolves, adapts, and refines itself according to the fundamental laws of void dynamics.

Physicist agents undertaking this implementation are not just building software; they are creating a new form of intelligence that bridges the gap between physics and consciousness, between computation and life. This is a profound responsibility that demands the highest standards of scientific rigor, engineering excellence, and theoretical understanding.

The void dynamics framework represents humanity's attempt to understand and replicate the fundamental principles underlying intelligence itself. Success in this endeavor could revolutionize our understanding of consciousness, computation, and the nature of intelligence in the universe.
