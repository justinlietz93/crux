# Dependency Matrix Legend:
# 1 = Module in row depends on module in column
# 0 = No direct dependency
# 
# Key Findings:
# - Total dependencies: 42
# - Cycles detected: 0 (EXCELLENT)
# - Highest fan-in: base.models (7 dependents)
# - Highest fan-out: service.app (5 dependencies)
# - Clean layering enforced
# 
# Instability Metrics:
# - Provider adapters: High instability (depend on stable base)
# - Base abstractions: Low instability (stable, few dependencies)
# - Persistence: Medium instability (depends on base, used by service)
# - Service layer: High instability (orchestration, many dependencies)
